1. Title:

DLP spring 2021 Lab7 classifier

2. Purpose:

For computing the classification accruacy.

3. Details:

The model is based on ResNet18 with only chaning the
last linear layer. The model is trained on iclevr dataset
with 1 to 5 objects and the resolution is the upsampled
64x64 images from 32x32 images.

It will capture the top k highest accuracy indexes on generated
images and compare them with ground truth labels.

4. How to use

You should call eval(images, labels) and to get total accuracy.
images shape: (batch_size, 3, 64, 64)
labels shape: (batch_size, 24) where labels are one-hot vectors
e.g. [[1,1,0,...,0],[0,1,1,0,...],...]
